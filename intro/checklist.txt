Development Checklist
======================

This list is inspired by the classic article by Joel Spolsky entitled `The Joel Test 12 Steps to Better Code`_.

Using Virtual Environments used by Application
-----------------------------------------------

Virtual environment is strongly encouraged for any Python development. When compiling Python from source, we would normally install all binaries in some folder, so we can use different Python versions for different projects.

This is particularly true with the Apache Web server and mod_wsgi module, when the module is compiled against specific Python version, and loaded as per Apache procedure.

Standard Python library is used to create a virtual environment. After creation, 
the new environment must be "sourced", and all packages installed with pip:

   .. code-block:: console

    source ~/Downloads/py3.9/bin/activate
    pip install jam.py
    pip install pandas


The above command will install jam.py and pandas packages into ``~/Downloads/py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/`` directory. We can have as many virtual environments as needed.

.. note::
    It is advisable to have Production and Development environments. 



Using the Source Control
-----------------------------------------

Using Source Control is encouraged with Jam.py Export functionality. Since all Jam.py code is stored in the internal database, it is possible to only Source Control the admin.sqlite database.

However, for the static files, for example external JavaScript libraries, or CSS files, the best approach would be using Export which fetches all objects into one compressed file. 


Unit Testing 
-------------

Currently, Jam.py is using ``pytest`` and Chai/Mocha
