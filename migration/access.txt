MS Access migration
=====================

Congratulations on the decision to `migrate` Access to the Web!

After all, it is moving to the modern JavaScript with Bootstrap and jQuery technology! 
Which is powered by Python.


Jam.py is not exclusively developed for Access migration though. Just like Django (Python) or CodeIgniter (PHP), is not.
Both products are not specialised for the databases oriented applications, even though one could migrate Access to any of those.

However, Jam.py is specialised. Just like Access is.

Before considering migrating Access (or any proprietary software), to the Web with the help of Jam.py, please review some 
answers below. Which might help with understanding what to expect from Jam.py. 


Top Migration Questions
=======================

The MS Access might be a `bread and butter` for many developers out there. Particularly in some 
specific industries like the Law practices or similar. And fair enough. It is the right tool for the job. 

However, the RISK is that in some years to come, the developers will retire. I know, I'm one of them.
Hence, where will the business find people to maintain their expensive application? Maybe they already 
hired the MSSQL database administrator, since the Access developers told them to do so. The DBA's might be around in years to come, but the Access developers? Or better, THE Access itself?

Hence, the faster we move away from proprietary database AND Front End application, the better. Simply because the technology will be around way after the MS Access is gone. This is business after all, let's put aside the emotions. The HTML is here to stay. Who remembers the Netscape any more? Or Mosaic?


1. Complacency
--------------

.. pull-quote::
        `Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive. Andy Grove`


      The application might be compliant for some business, however does it run on the Web? Apple Mac? Tablet?
      That is exactly what we are addressing with the migration. The `Future`.

2. VBA?
-------

.. pull-quote::

        `Does your application rely on heaps of VBA for Business Rules (BR)?`

   The VBA cant be migrated to the Web. The question is what is it used for? 5000 lines of VBA code
   might be a dinosaur code! Is it possible to use Python with 200 lines of code? How about 10 lines?
   
   In addition, what might not be recognised is the speed. The VBA just does not compare with Python. The Developers will argue that 
   this is due to the quality of code. Not quite true. The code is just as important as garbage collection, or utilising memory, etc.
   And this is where Python shines. It replaces massive technological debt with a few lines of code.

   For example, the BR might be a way the application authenticates users (ie. a table with username, password, role). Jam.py can reuse the Access tables used for users, so
   no issues with that. When the database is migrated, the users authentication table is there and we can use exactly twelve
   lines of Python code, as seen on Demo, to authenticate users with the roles. 

   

3. Excel?
---------

.. pull-quote::
        `Does your application depends on Excel or some other Office products?`

    This might be a show stopper, simply because the organisation will not let go of Excel. This might be 
    particularly true within some Financial institution. The good news is Python can read/write Excel 
    document formats. For sure Access has better interoperability with those products. It is the Desktop
    application after all. However, some operations within Access using Excel, might take a long time, sucking up the resources.
    Not so with Python and Excel. It is super easy to integrate Excel with Jam.py application using `DataTables`_. 
    
    Good resource for using `Excel with Python`_.

4. Queries
-----------

.. pull-quote::
        `Most of the "applications" consist of a single hard-coded query or a single linked table.` 

    The above is a quote from `Front-End for MS Access migration?`_ It is an old thread with all points still valid.
    With Jam.py, one does not write queries. It is absolutely possible to do so, if needed. 
    
    It is a low-code framework after all. And that can open the whole new world for a group of developers! Because
    each of them can work simultaneously on some other part of application, being the Forms or the Server procedures,
    everything is instantly visible to everyone with the right privileges.
    
    Hence, everything is simplified. The Jam.py framework will build complex queries just like Access does, with a few
    clicks of the mouse. Contrary to the Access, this query, infact the complete application, will work on any supported
    database. Develop the application and deploy it to preferred database. Simple. No need to 
    rewrite the queries.

5. Primary Keys
---------------

.. pull-quote::
        `Be assured, there are a number of applications out there with no Primary Keys in Access.`

    The Primary Key (PK), is a must with all relational databases. With no PK, Jam.py cannot reference the Foreign Keys (FK).
    Not only relevant to Jam.py, Django does not do that either. Since both are sharing similar ORM. So no matter how 
    we migrate Access to the Web, with which technology, the PK simply must exist. This is even true with Access web 
    applications and web databases. 
      

6. Deployment
-------------

.. pull-quote::
        `If possible, have the front-ends copied locally on each workstation, for performance reasons.`

    Again, the same source `Front-End for MS Access migration?`_ See how nothing really changed from year 2008?

    Some Access Developers would argue that RDP or Citrix or even VPN is the way to deploy the Front End application
    to the Web. All this technologies were around in 2008. Nothing new.

    What is new is the Cloud. 

    Regarding Access packaging, some are using one distributable file, sometimes protected with the encryption. Jam.py 
    can do exactly the same. Even more, one can use SQLCipher to protect the IP. Combining both within an portable 
    application, which can run from, for example Windows x64 with no installation at all, is a powerful deployment 
    and secure method. With such approach, the application database might be off-site or even embedded and encrypted with
    SQLCipher. 
    This method can provide safe and secure access even from a portable drive in an off-line environment, for example with 
    no Internet access at all. Only the local area network is needed for more than one user.

    Regarding Web servers deployment, Jam.py application can be deployed in a few seconds. Which can serve thousands of users simultaneously. Jam.py flagship application is supporting 2000 remote locations, each with 10-20 users. There is no
    need for installation of anything and costs almost nothing.

Hope the above sparked some interest. Even though there are probably more reasons why one should or should not try 
to migrate Access application to the Web. 
   
Where from here?

https://jampyapplicationbuilder.com/conv/


Depending on file size, the conversion might take a few moments! Please wait to see: File is successfully converted! Access Application with your data from here

After the Access file is uploaded and converted with no errors:

- link to Application Builder will show up, which is using the sqlite3 data converted from Access instantly available on the Web! It is super easy and takes no time!If not interested at all in building the Application, please click on *Export* to download the DB as zip file which contains the sqlite3 file. The converted sqlite3 database has a long name exactly the same as in provided link. This is to increase safety and security for all downloads.

.. note::
    If interested in showing data on the Web, meaning using Jam.py application:


The Application Builder link will set the Database to "DB manual mode". This means your new database is safe from changing the structure, like incidentally deleting the table or similar. If you would like to continue migrating Access to Web with the help of Jam.py framework, import all tables into the "Test Import" Group (click on Test Import/Import button), taking care of all needed DB fields correction or missing info. All fields must have a datatype if not already recognized. The "DB field name" should not be touched, the "Caption" is normally MS Access field caption, and the "Name" must be valid JavaScript naming standard, in short, no spaces, special characters, etc. To help out with the process, here are some videos:

After Importing some tables, just replace **builder.html** with **index.html** from the link to access your Application. Sometimes the index.html page will not show anything due to Load Balancer issues. Please try after some time. Or start over. One can even set the App password or create users within the Builder. The default App/Builder username/password is admin/111, change it on Project/Users and set Project/Parameters/Safe Mode to restrict access, etc. One can set all `lookups`_ to different tables as usual. It should be a fully functional App with all the bells and whistles!


.. _lookups: https://jampyapplicationbuilder.com/docs/intro/tutorial01/lookup_list.html

It is important to note that once the Access file is converted and all tables Imported through the builder.html, it is not needed to use this service at all. Immediately use the **Export [CTRL+E]** option and download the Export file. Than, install the `Python Jam.py`_ framework locally or on the server, create the `New application`_, `Import`_ the same downloaded file, and point the Application to sqlite database as per creating the New application. That is all.

Notes/Issues
-------------

This tool is for the database tables only, it does not convert MS Access file with no tables in it. Hence, **no need to upload a Front end application**, which probably connects to SQL Server or some other database(s). Output will be empty, or it will contain only a few tables.

**The process is expecting that the Primary Key exist on all tables.** Please address and fix this issue before attempting the conversion. Only Use One Numeric Field as the Primary Key, ie. **AutoNumber field**.

MS Access might have a **special character, space, slash/backslash, dash (-),quote(')**, etc for the **table field, as well as table name**. The conversion will try to replace those, however, we would advise to fix the issues in MS Access, before attempting the conversion.

The conversion will fail if there are **linked tables in MS Access**. Please remove any linked tables before attempting the conversion.

The conversion will fail if Access is using utf-16-li, no need to try again. No log or link will be produced and we suggest fixing Access.

There might be an #Error in the Access field, please fix it if conversion fails, and attempt again. **The best is to inspect the Log file, sometimes clearly showing the error**. If the log file is empty, something went wrong. No need to try again if Access wasn't fixed.

Please do not upload confidential, private or **password protected/encrypted database**. If conversion to SQLite3 is needed for such data, the tool can be provided on `demand`_. Password protected database conversion might fail, no need to try again.

Now what?
=========

First of all, thanks for trying the migration! 

Now that the database is converted to SQLite3, let's see what we can do with it. 

Tables
------

In order to use the automatic displaying of data (automatically with CRUD), the table name is used as table Caption! That is, if the Caption was
not changed during the table Import.

Hence, if the database table name is ``django_ledger_accountmodel``, than the JavaScript variable Name is also ``django_ledger_accountmodel``!
And more importantly, the visible table Caption on the Application is ``django_ledger_accountmodel`` as well.

So maybe better to set the table ``Caption`` to ``Account``! 

This is also true for any table column during the table Import. We are working on the new feature to improve this. 

Finally, the application might look like this:

.. image:: _images/django01.png
	:scale: 80 %
	:align: center
	:alt: Django Ledger



As mentioned, the Linked tables from MS Access is impossible to import, hence they do not exist.



Indexes
-------

As stated, the migration does not import indexes. This is due to a number of constraints. The good news is once the data is converted, 
the indexes can be created within the Builder. The good practise is to index all `lookups` on some table.

Why is this important? Because doing it within the Builder, all indexes are kept and can be recreated on any supported database engine.
If the indexes exist within the database only, the Builder would not know about it and they would be lost when moving Application 
to the preferred database.

Foreign Keys
------------

Similar scenario, after the data is migrated, we can create FK's within the Builder. Again, the Jam.py utilises `lookups` for looking up for data.


Users table
-----------

If already using some MS Access database table for users authentication, the only thing missing is the Role `lookup`. It is quite possible that 
the role is hard-coded in Access, and this is what we are trying to avoid. Use `lookups` as much as possible.

The process is described in here: `How to authenticate from custom users table`_.

Obviously, it is the best practise to use password hash for storing the passwords. This simply means adding a column with a **Password hash** text to 
the `Users` or similar table.
